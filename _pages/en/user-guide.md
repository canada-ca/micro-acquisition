## To do the work and get paid you need:
<!--markdownlint-enable MD026-->

1. __An account on a public source code repository.__
  You can work on a repository of your choice.
  Some repository options include [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/){:target="_blank"} (bilingual), [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} (English only), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/){:target="_blank"} (English only).
1. __Familiarity with Git version control system.__
  If you have not used Git before or need a refresher, this [Git cheat sheet](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet){:target="_blank"} includes all the basic commands.
1. __The ability to accept payment from a credit card using a payment system or via PayPal.__
  If you choose to use a payment system, it must accept payment via Visa card.
  If you would like to accept payment via PayPal, visit [how to get set up to accept PayPal payment](https://www.paypal.com/ca/business/accept-payments?locale.x=en_CA){:target="_blank"}.

_Note: simply having a credit card does not mean you are able to accept payment by credit card._

**You will need all three of these things to work on a micro-acquisition contract.**

## Looking for more information?

If you need clarification on the details of an open opportunity before applying, please email your question(s) to [microacquisition@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca](mailto:microacquisition@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca).

If you have a question about an open opportunity, please send it to us as fast as possible.
Answers to these questions are posted on the website for everyone. Questions may be submitted up until two business days before an opportunity closes.

If you have questions about the micro-acquisiiton pilot in general, you can also send these questions by email to [microacquisition@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca](mailto:microacquisition@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca).

## Are you ready to apply?

To apply to an opportunity, fill out an <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/application-form.pdf %}" title="application form" target="_blank"> application form</a> and send it to [microacquisition@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca](mailto:microacquisition@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca).
Application evaluation criteria are marked as a pass/fail (there is no scoring).

__A pass is required for each evaluation criteria in order for you to be considered for an opportunity.__

We encourage you to apply to other opportunities that may interest you.

<div class="well">
<p>By applying to an opportunity, you agree to:</p>
<ul><li>complete the work by the completion date in the opportunity statement; and</li>
<li>be paid by credit card (Visa) or PayPal </li></ul>

</div>

## After you apply

Once the closing date has passed, applications are evaluated.
If multiple suppliers pass the evaluation criteria, we assign a number to those suppliers.
Then, we use a random number generator to select the winning supplier from this group.
You will be advised by email whether you _have_ or _have not_ been selected.

__If you are not selected, you may [contact us](mailto:microacquisition@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca) to request a debrief.__

## Work and payment

If you are selected, you will be asked to sign a _terms and conditions document_  before the work is started.
This is the  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/en/terms.md %}" title="Terms and Conditions">template terms and conditions</a>  document that will be used for all micro-acquisition opportunities.
Once this document is signed, you are put in contact with the client.
Once the work is complete, it is assessed against the Work Acceptance Criteria.

If the work _does not meet_ the Work Acceptance Criteria in the opportunity statement, you will have the opportunity to revise your work.
With that in mind, we recommend that you deliver your work in advance of the deadline to allow time for revisions.

If the work _does meet_ the Work Acceptance Criteria in the opportunity statement, you send an invoice for the fixed price of the opportunity, plus any applicable taxes to [NA-FPS-SFA-GD@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca](mailto:NA-FPS-SFA-GD@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca).

You may use your own invoice template if you have one, or use this  [invoice template](../../assets/invoice_template.odt).
It includes all the fields required for payment.
