# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<details id="faq-001">
<summary>I'm a recent graduate, can I apply to these opportunities?</summary>
<p>Yes! If you meet the criteria, you can definitely put your name in the hat! The micro-acquisition pilot aims to make it as easy as possible to work with the government on low dollar value opportunities. That means that even if it's your first time dealing with the government, you shouldn't be overwhelmed by complex procurement processes.</p>

<p>We want you to be able to spend your time on the work at hand rather than filling in paperwork, and get paid as fast as possible once the work is completed.</p>

<summary>I'm not a full time developer, should I try to apply to an opportunity?</summary>
<p>Yes! The opportunities are meant to be open to as many people as possible and even if you don't consider yourself a professional coder, you may have the right skill set to solve the issue at hand!</p>

<p>The application process itself involves little upfront work and the success criteria are defined before getting started. If you are selected and you deliver the goods, then you're paid, whether your full time job is coding or not.</p>

<summary>I've never provided services for the government before. Can I apply to an opportunity?</summary>

<summary>Can people employed by the Government of Canada apply to micro-acquisition opportunities?</summary>

<p>Yes. Government of Canada employees may apply to micro-acquisition opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Intellectual Property for any micro-acquisition opportunity rests with the supplier.
<strong>You must get sign off (by email) from your Director General (DG)</strong> outlining that "the work is being performed on your own time without government resources, and that IP rights would stay with you".
This is required before work can begin.</p>
<p>This is because anything produced by an employee of the Crown (whether as part of their job or via a contract) is considered to be Crown property as it is still being created "under the direction or control of the Crown" (from section 8.1 of the ESDC Intellectual Property Management Policy).
Clause 8.1.3 (a) does specify that this is "subject to any agreement to the contrary", and this is where the sign off from the DG is necessary.</p>

<p>Additionally, keep in mind that complying with the <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32627">Directive on Conflicts of Interest</a> is a condition of your employment. This directive requires the following of persons employed by the Government of Canada:</p>

<blockquote>“4.2.3 Reporting in writing to their deputy head all outside employment and activities, assets, liabilities and interests that might give rise to a real, apparent or potential conflict of interest in relation to their official duties and responsibilities;”</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>“4.2.9 Seeking the approval of their deputy head before entering into a contractual arrangement with the Government of Canada for which they are receiving any direct or indirect benefit or income;”</blockquote>

<p>Please refer to the <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25049">Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector</a>, the Directive on Conflict of Interest and your department’s code of conduct for more information.</p>
