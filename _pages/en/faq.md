The micro-acquisition pilot aims to make it as easy as possible to work with the government on low dollar value opportunities. That means that even if it's your first time dealing with the government, you shouldn't be overwhelmed by complex procurement processes.</p>

<p>We want you to be able to spend your time on the work at hand rather than filling in paperwork, and get paid as fast as possible once the work is completed.</p>

<summary>Can people employed by the Government of Canada apply to micro-acquisition opportunities?</summary>

<p>If you are a Government of Canada employee, you may apply to micro-acquisition opportunities.
