# Frequently asked questions

1. **Can people employed by the Government of Canada apply to micro-acquisition opportunities?**

   If you are a Government of Canada employee, you may apply to micro-acquisition opportunities. However, keep in mind that complying with the [Directive on Conflicts of Interest](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32627){:target="_blank"} is a condition of your employment. This directive requires the following of persons employed by the Government of Canada:

   “4.2.3 Reporting in writing to their deputy head all outside employment and activities, assets, liabilities and interests that might give rise to a real, apparent or potential conflict of interest in relation to their official duties and responsibilities;”

   and

   “4.2.9 Seeking the approval of their deputy head before entering into a contractual arrangement with the Government of Canada for which they are receiving any direct or indirect benefit or income;”

   Please refer to the [Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25049){:target="_blank"}, the Directive on Conflict of Interest and your department’s code of conduct for more information.
