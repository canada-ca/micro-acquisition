    <h2>How is this different from other Government of Canada procurement  opportunities?</h2>
    <p>Our goal is to make the process simpler for you from start to finish by:</p>
    <ul class="gliph-list">
        <li>
            <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-send"></span>
            <strong>Easier application process.</strong> Complete and submit your application in 2 hours or less.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-repeat"></span>
            <strong> Quick selection turnaround.</strong> The evaluation of applications for an opportunity is fast and light-touch. We anticipate announcing the winning supplier two business days following the closing of an opportunity.</li>
        <li>
            <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span>
            <strong> Fewer hurdles to winning opportunities.</strong> No lengthy pre-approval processes, anonymized evaluation process to reduce bias and all work is done virtually so an NCR location is not required.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-usd"></span>
            <strong>Faster payment.</strong> Deliver your code and receive your payment by credit card or PayPal.

    <h2>About this pilot</h2>
    <p>This micro-acquisition pilot project is being run for one year at <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development.html" target="_blank">Employment and Social Development Canada</a> through a partnership between the Innovation Information Technology Branch and the Chief Financial Officer Branch.</p>
    <p>This pilot would not have been possible without the help of the <a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/" target="_blank">BC Developers Exchange</a>/<a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/marketplace" target="_blank">BC Digital Marketplace</a> who have lead the way for years, and have generously shared their expertise.</p>
    <p>We have also endeavoured to learn from the lessons of the <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/devex" target="_blank">GC Developers Exchange</a> (the Government of Canada's first foray into low dollar value procurement of open source code).</p>
    <p><a href="mailto:microacquisition@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca">Contact us</a> if you are an ESDC team with a coding opportunity!</p>
