## What is Micro-Acquisition

This is a pilot project being run for one year out of Employment and Social Development Canada through a partnership between the Innovation Information Technology Branch and the Chief Financial Officer Branch.

On this web site you will find opportunities to be paid for coding work which meets the following criteria:

- delivered code must be licensed as open source
- contract value of $10K or less
- all work is unclassified

## How is this different from other government of Canada procurement processes

- **The application process is easy.** Our goal is that you will be able to apply in 2 hours or less.
- **You will be paid quickly.** We are using credit cards/PayPal for payment to ensure you do not have to wait long once you have delivered your code.
- **Fewer barriers in your way.** All the work is unclassified which means it can be done from your home on your computer and you do not need to have completed a government security screening. </div>

## Gratitude

This pilot would not have been possible without the help of the kind folks at the [BC Developers Exchange](https://bcdevexchange.org/)/[BC Digital Marketplace](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/marketplace) who have lead the way for years, and from the wonderful people at the Office of Small and Medium Enterprises who have generously shared their expertise.
We have also endeavoured to learn from the lessons of the [GC Developers Exchange](https://github.com/canada-ca/devex) (the Government of Canada's first foray into low dollar value acquisitions for open source code).
