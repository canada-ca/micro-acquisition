# Supplier user guide

## Before you apply, do you have

### 1. An account on an public source code repository

You can work on a repository of your choice.
Some repository options include [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) (bilingual), [GitHub](https://github.com.com/) (english only), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) (english only)

### 2. Familiarity with Git version control system

> Note: add a link to a bilingual user guide

### 3. The ability to accept payment from a credit card using a payment system or via PayPal

If you have never accepted payment via a credit card or via PayPal, learn about how to get set up to:

- accept credit cards using a payment system *add a link to some info about this - is there an open source option?* or
- accept payment via PayPal [get set up to accept payment via PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/ca/business/get-paid?kid=p42863580764&gclid=Cj0KCQiAyoeCBhCTARIsAOfpKxhGE1kaeCjl6C4w_xMLIHHGw-EWc9FgPpFUvZXgjFzH81ptH4MTBEgaAoYHEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds).

Note that simply having a credit card does not mean you are able to accept payment by credit card.

**You will need all of the above three things to work on a micro-acquisition contract.**

## Got questions?

If you need clarification on the details of an open opportunity before applying, please send your question(s) in an email to *add email address*.
If you have a question about an opportunity, get them in as fast as possible, answers to these questions need to be posted on the website for everyone so we can't except questions with less than 24 hours to an opportunity closing.

## Ready to apply?

You apply to Micro-Acquisition opportunities by email to this address *add email address*.
Before sending your email, verify that you have included the following in your email:

- The name of the opportunity you are applying for
- Your name
- Your business name (if different from your name)
- Written affirmations as follows:
  - "I can complete the work by *add completion date from the opportunity statement*"
  - "I agree to be paid by credit card or PayPal"
  - "I have the skills required to complete the work described in the *add name of the opportunity* opportunity statement
- A text description of your experience with the required skills (500 words or less)
Note that these requirements are marked as a pass/fail.
You will not be graded on each but a pass is required for each item in order to be able to be considered for an opportunity

## After applying

Once the opportunity deadline has passed, the applications will be evaluated.
If multiple suppliers pass the evaluation, those suppliers will be assigned a number.
A random number generator will then be used to select the winning supplier.

You will be advised via email if you have (or have not) been selected.

Still to do......Anticipate questions and include the answers in the documentation (advice from OSME)
