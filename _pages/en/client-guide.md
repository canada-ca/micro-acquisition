# Client user guide

To be a client of this pilot you must be an ESDC or Service Canada employee.

Thank you for considering being part of this pilot and enabling small businesses and freelancers across the country to access GC contract dollars.

We think you will find some fantastic talent!

**Step 1:** Think you'd like to do a micro-acquisition?
Get in touch with us!
Here is the email: *add client email*

**Step 2:** determining if your need meets the eligibility criteria for the pilot and whether we have capacity to run it (we can explain what this means)

**Step 3:** You write a description of the work required.
We have a template *add link* for that!
Want to see what descriptions of work can look like?
Check out the BC Digital marketplace for examples.
*Note: It is important to get this piece right as if it is unclear to suppliers you will spend a lot of time fielding questions and answering/translating answers (they all have to be posted on the website within a 48 hour time frame â€“ less if the opportunity is only posted for a week)*

**Step 4:** The funds get committed and the translated opportunity is posted on the website.
*Note: to get the opportunity posted on the website, you will need to open a Pull Request on the repo (on GitHub).
If you don't know how to do this, no problem! We can coach you through it. Message us at (add client email address)*

**Step 5:** You evaluate the suppliers who express an interest. (we have guidance *add link* for that)

**Step 6:** You select a supplier and the work begins on an open repository.

**Step 7:** You assess the delivered code against criteria that were included in the web posting. (we have guidance *add link* for that)

**Step 8:** You accept the code and the supplier is paid.

**Step 9:** You add an entry for the code in the [Open Resource Exchange](https://code.open.canada.ca/en/index.html) so others can find and reuse the code.
