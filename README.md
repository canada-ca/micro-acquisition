## Micro-acquisition pilot
The Micro-acquisition pilot ran from June 2021 to May 2022.  It was led by Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) in a partnership between IITB and CFOB.

Driven by the results of the red tape reduction report, the Gartner Procurement 2020 report, and the knowledge that while Digital Standards require open first working in the open by default, very little code developed in ESDC was being licensed as open source and shared openly, we felt there was an opportunity to use procurement as a lever.

We also felt strongly that there is a lot of coding talent that remains untapped by the Federal Public Service and that by simplifying low dollar value procurement of code, we could not only increase access to that talent but enable distribution of GC contract dollars to those who might normally face barriers.

We worked to understand those barriers and smash them along the way – can we pay for code using PayPal to get money into coders hands fast and not require them to wait 30 days or have a point of sale system? Heck yes we can!

We also feel really proud and glad of the partnership forged between IITB and CFOB as part of this pilot proving not only that we can but that we must work together across branches when designing any type of service or system.

Ultimately this pilot didn’t meet many of its target success metrics. We thought we would do 10 procurements via Micro-Acquisition. In the end we only posted one opportunity and while a supplier was selected, the opportunity was terminated for non-delivery and no payment was made.

Change initiatives are hard. We faced a number of challenges finding clients who had the need to procure small chunks of coding work at ESDC, we failed to set our executive sponsors up for success and faced push back from ESDC union reps when they learned about it midway through the project.

But that is not to say this wasn’t a worthwhile effort. The lessons learned from experiments like this are of equal value to meeting success metrics.  We learned a lot over the course of this pilot. To learn more, read our closeout blog post (link) and report (link).
