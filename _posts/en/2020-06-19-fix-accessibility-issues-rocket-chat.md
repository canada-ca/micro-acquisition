## Description

### Background

<!-- Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam venenatis tincidunt ipsum et vulputate. Nunc ultricies, diam eget blandit ornare, purus libero dapibus turpis, vel faucibus felis est sed libero. In et erat in mi ultrices dapibus.

Interdum et malesuada fames ac ante ipsum primis in faucibus. Sed vitae tellus a erat efficitur posuere in efficitur lorem. Maecenas accumsan fringilla odio, quis aliquam est suscipit at. Nulla viverra lectus sed tortor imperdiet porttitor. Etiam sed tempus magna, non pulvinar mauris. Sed ultricies pharetra nibh nec gravida. Phasellus fringilla justo in semper finibus. Vestibulum eget nibh nec erat pharetra iaculis. In porta ipsum ac libero varius, vel condimentum metus vestibulum. Fusce scelerisque ut diam nec pulvinar. Aenean ipsum risus, sagittis sed euismod semper, varius eget augue. Mauris nec mi tincidunt, fringilla diam non, vulputate velit. Aenean in nunc turpis. Ut rutrum vehicula diam nec mattis. -->
<!-- In order to deploy the micro-acquisition pilot rapidly and easily, a low tech solution and process was chosen for suppliers to submit their applications.  This process involves suppliers sending their application for a micro-acquisition opportunity in the body of an email to a generic email inbox.

Within the application suppliers:

1. Must certify that they are Canadian and/or First Nations, Métis or Inuit OR that they have work permits to work in Canada.

2. Are asked to voluntarily provide some demographic information about themselves

Once bids are received they are manually anonymized and consolidated into a single file so that they can be sent on to the ESDC client for evaluation once the submission deadline has passed.

Demographic information that is voluntarily submitted is also anonymized and stored to be used to determine the success of the pilot

The challenges with the current process:

1. No validation on the supplier’s application.  This means there is a high likelihood for mistakes. If a supplier forgets to include the text certifying ‘Canadian and/or....’ or includes the wrong text, their application will be rejected but only once the deadline has passed.  Validation cannot be manually done on applications as applications could come in minutes before the deadline and that would not give us time to write back (via email) to say, you have forgotten something.

2. Suppliers will be less likely to provide demographic information about themselves in the email as they will have to type or copy/paste the text into an email (they do not have the option to simply select checkboxes with the current process).

3. If the demand for the micro-acquisition pilot is high and we get 1000+ applications for an opportunity, the existing manual process is not sustainable. -->

- If the submission of the form is not successful (e.g. if some mandatory fields are missing) this message should be displayed “Please fill in the <field name> field”.

- The submitted form application must also meet the following non-functional requirements:

  - Accessibility
