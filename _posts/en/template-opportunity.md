## Description

### Background

<!-- Provide the supplier with an understanding of who they will be working for (Division, Branch). Also include all relevant background e.g.  what work, if any, has been done in this space in the past? Is this a net new project, or is this a continuation of previous efforts? What is the problem that needs to be solved? It is best to provide as much information here as possible as a lack of clarity would result in many questions from suppliers (the answers to which will need to be translated and posted on the website) -->

### Opportunity

<!-- In this section explain in detail the work are you expecting the supplier to complete. From this this supplier needs to be able to assess their level of effort required to complete the project. This section should fully explain all aspects of the opportunity and all deliverables that must be completed for the vendor to fulfill their responsibilities for the contract. As you are writing the description of the work, consider reviewing the guidance statements from the GC Enterprise Architecture Framework and whether the work can be described in the form of a test (aligning with a shift towards Test Driven Development). Also include here any links to information that the supplier would need in order to fully understand the scope of work (e.g. data tables if the work requires data analysis).  Remember that all information in this template will be posted on the Micro-Acquisition website so must be Unclassified. -->

## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- The acceptance criteria describe how the code will be assessed once it is delivered by the supplier. 
The acceptance criteria must include:
A criteria related to the license file in the acceptance criteria.
A criteria related to the requirements (linking back to the description of those requirements in the opportunity statement)
The acceptance criteria could also include:
A criteria related to the quality assurance tests that the code will be run through and what result from those tests is required in order for the code to be accepted. If possible, include the tests/set up the CI/CD pipeline on the GitHub or GitLab repo where the code will be delivered for full transparency and so that suppliers can run the tests themselves.

It is important that this section is very clear to suppliers as only deliverables that meet acceptance criteria will result in payment.  More information on the acceptance criteria can be found in the Acceptance Criteria guidance.
Example:
This is a fixed price opportunity governed by the terms of the Micro-Acquisition pilot. To be paid the fixed price, you must meet all of the following criteria:
The code must be delivered with the following open source license _____________________
The code must fulfill the requirements specified in the opportunity description
The code must get a pass mark on the following tests:
Test a
Test b
Test c -->

## Proposal Evaluation Criteria

<!-- The Evaluation Criteria explain how ESDC will evaluate the applications submitted by suppliers. These criteria identify what must be submitted and how it will be evaluated. 
When developing your criteria, remember that we want suppliers to be able to apply to any opportunity in two hours or less.  Also consider that there could be 20+ people applying to any opportunity and we want the work that you must do as evaluators to be easy and not time consuming. With those two things in mind, we recommend that all opportunities include the below evaluation criteria.  You can find more information on why we chose these criteria in the Evaluation Criteria guidance.  
Example:
Your proposal will be scored using the following criteria:
Using 250 words or less, please provide:
Confirmation that you have the skills to complete this work. Include examples of how you obtained and/or have used these skills before. Examples could include: previous work experience, schoolwork, Civic Tech projects etc.)
